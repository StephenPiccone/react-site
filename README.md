# React Facts

This is the first project working with React, learning the basics of React. This includes learning how to use and render components, with the possibility of adding more features in the future to make the project more robust.

## Conditional Rendering

The project was revisited later to add conditional rendering through the light/dark mode slider. Reacts useState was implimented to add a state variable for the current light/dark mode setting, which would adjust based on the users selection of light/dark. This state variable determined which css classes would be applied to the document in order to give the apprearence of a light/dark setting.
